## üíª Software Overview

### Web Server
- Hosts a web page to control the motor and display food levels.
- Uses **HTTP requests** to trigger motor rotation or update food status.

### Motor Control
- Implements stepper motor rotation using a state machine.
- The motor rotates for **2 seconds** when triggered.

### Timer Functionality
- Automatically triggers the motor every **12 hours** for a scheduled feeding.

### Food Monitoring
- Uses **IR sensor data** to determine if the food level is sufficient.
- Displays food status on the **LCD** and **web interface**.

### Debugging
- Ensured **precise motor timing**.
- Calibrated the **IR sensor** for accurate readings.
- Improved **Wi-Fi connectivity** to minimize disconnects.
